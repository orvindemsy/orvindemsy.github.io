      <title>Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern</title>

      <description>Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern is a modification of CSP where raw EEG signal is being bandpass-filtered with 9 specific bands (0-4Hz, 4-8Hz, 8-12Hz, &amp;hellip; 36-40 Hz) before CSP is applied on each filtered EEG band.
This work will implement FBCSP on BCI Compeition Dataset 2a. This work will only classify two class, i.e. right and left hand imagery out of total four class.
Early result on three subjects shows FBCSP gives better accuracy than CSP.</description>

      <title>Basic Two-Class BCI Motor Imagery Display</title>

      <description>This program serves as interface for two-class BCI motor imagery application. Two major programs are used in this application, the first one is the GUI program which is built in python language. Second one is the program that interacts with g.tec USB AMP device to record EEG signal. This one is an exe application generated by program written in C#. In this document the first program (GUI) may be referred as ‘master’, while the second one (recording) is referred as ‘slave’.</description>

      <title>Common Spatial Pattern</title>

      <description>Brain-computer interface requires several steps in order to work. Among those step are feature extraction. In order to be able to operate BCI system optimally a powerful feature extraction method is required. In motor-imagery (MI) paradigm a commonly used method for feature extarction is called common-spatial pattern (CSP). This is my implementation of CSP algorithm on BCI dataset IV 2a.

      <title>Coursera Machine Learning Course</title>

      <description>This project is a python implementation of Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning Course on Coursera, the original course was done in MATLAB.
Although scikit-learn package provide robust functionality to perform machine learning, this code doesn&amp;rsquo;t use it. This work also serves as an exercise for me to learn a python language.
The course syllabus is taught over the span of eleven weeks, the details of each week&amp;rsquo;s topic are as follows:</description>
