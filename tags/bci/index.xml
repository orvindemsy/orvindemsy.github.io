      <description>Abstract Abstract—Brain-computer interface (BCI) requires calibration phase to learn user-specific decoder that translates brain signals into desired commands. Calibration phase can be lengthy and exhausting for motor imagery-based (MI) BCI, and can potentially reduce the effectiveness of BCI system. Transfer learning (TL) approaches have been implemented in the field of BCI to tackle this problem. Transfer learning based on domain adaptation reduces domain discrepancy between two domains. Transfer component analysis (TCA) is one domain adaptation technique that maps features of both domains into a new space while simultaneously reducing their domain discrepancy.</description>

      <description>Here comes my first experiment combining two TL techniques for BCI in two different BCI steps. Now, before going further into details here&amp;rsquo;s the outline of this blog :
 Basic BCI Steps and TL in BCI Euclidean Alignment (EA) Weighted Transfer Learning (wLTL) EA-wLTL Attempt  To keep it sane, I will try to introduce each section as minimum as possible without leaving crucial points. In the end section I will show my result, which and possible future improvement.</description>

      <description>This program serves as interface for two-class BCI motor imagery application. Two major programs are used in this application, the first one is the GUI program which is built in python language. Second one is the program that interacts with g.tec USB AMP device to record EEG signal. This one is an exe application generated by program written in C#. In this document the first program (GUI) may be referred as ‘master’, while the second one (recording) is referred as ‘slave’.</description>

      <description>Brain-computer interface requires several steps in order to work. Among those step are feature extraction. In order to be able to operate BCI system optimally a powerful feature extraction method is required. In motor-imagery (MI) paradigm a commonly used method for feature extarction is called common-spatial pattern (CSP). This is my implementation of CSP algorithm on BCI dataset IV 2a.
